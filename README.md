## How to Use:
- To start, click one of the buildings!
- To return to the town center, click "return to village".

## Technologies Used:
- React
- Bootstrap 
- Fetch API
- Google Cloud (maps API)


## Notes: 
This app was created as a practice excercise. It is not polished, nor is it designed responsively. It will not display properly on smaller screens. It will not be maintained, so if certain APIs change, their module in the app amy not work.
